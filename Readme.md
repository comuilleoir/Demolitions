# Demolition Notification Analysis Using Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project investigates patterns in demolition activities to aid urban development and planning in the City of Detroit. By merging demolition notice data with city-wide criminal incident reports, it aims to predict property vacancy or abandonment. The analysis covers data from January 2009 to April 2015.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Demolition notifications from the Ferndale City Open Data site and Detroit's city-wide criminal incident reports.
- **Data Analytics Techniques:** The process involves data preprocessing, normalization, exploratory data analysis, and modeling with a Random Forest algorithm. Special attention is given to model balancing and the integration of crime data.
- **Visualization Tools:** Utilizing Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib and seaborn to visualize patterns in demolition and crime data.

## Key Findings
- **Geographical Patterns:** Identified key geographical patterns in demolition activities and their correlation with crime rates.
- **Modeling Challenges:** Despite efforts in model optimization, including bagging techniques, challenges in accurately predicting property status were observed. This underlines the complexity of urban dynamics and the possible need for additional data.
- **Reduced Scope:** Given the limitations in improving model performance with existing data, a decision was made to reduce the scope of the outcomes.

## Repository Contents
- `Data`: Original and preprocessed datasets of demolition notifications. The crime data file is too large for Github but is available [here](https://data.world/detroit/dpd-crime-incidents-2009-2016).
- `Scripts`: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- `Project_Images`: Graphs and charts illustrating demolition trends and their correlation with crime data.
