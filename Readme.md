# Demolition Notification Analysis Using Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This project investigates patterns in demolition activities to aid urban development and planning. It merges demolition notice data with city-wide criminal incident reports to predict property vacancy or abandonment. The analysis utilizes data from January 2009 to April 2015, focusing on the City of Detroit.

## Methodology
- **Data Sources:** Demolition notifications from the Ferndale City Open Data site and city-wide criminal incident reports from Detroit.
- **Data Analytics Techniques:** Techniques include data preprocessing, normalisation, exploratory data analysis, and Random Forest modeling. A special focus is placed on balancing the model and incorporating crime data.
- **Visualization Tools:** Pythonâ€™s Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation, highlighting patterns in demolition and crime data.

## Key Findings
- Identification of key geographical patterns in demolition activities and their correlation with crime rates.
- Despite model optimisations, challenges in predicting property status with high accuracy were observed, indicating the complexity of urban dynamics.

## Repository Contents
- `Data`: Original and preprocessed datasets of demolition notifications. The crime data file is too large for Github, but is available at https://data.world/detroit/dpd-crime-incidents-2009-2016
- `Scripts`: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning, analysis, modeling, and visualisation.
- `Project_Images`: Generated graphs and charts illustrating demolition trends and their correlation with crime data.
